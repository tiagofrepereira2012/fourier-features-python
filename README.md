[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tiagofrepereira2012/fourier-features-python/blob/main/1.fourier-features-demo.ipynb)

Pytorch implementation of the paper **Tancik, Matthew, et al. "Fourier features let networks learn high frequency functions in low dimensional domains." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 7537-7547.** [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10739)

In case you want to run this locally you can use the environment.yml file to create a conda environment with all the dependencies.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate fourier-features-pytorch
jupyter-lab
```
